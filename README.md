# controllable-space-filling-curve

Before compiling the code you need some libraries:
* Boost
* OpenGL
* GLUT
* Eigen3

Once these libraries are installed, you can compile the code using
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

**Warning:** The code is currently being refactored. Instructions to use the code will be given in few days or week. We are working to make its use simpler.
